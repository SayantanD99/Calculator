Calculator Using C

A simple Calculator program using C.

This is a simple menu driven program. I have used switch cases and functions for achieving the calculator functionality.

I started building up this little project of mine while I was learning C and wanting to test my knowledge about those basic facts I tried out this little program of mine. 

I have also attached a sample output with the main code.
